# Content Based Filtering for Book Recommendation System

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Hybrid Recommendation System developed as part of a group project for NUS Computing school module called Mining Web Data for Business Insights. The project integrates multiple recommendation approaches to enhance the accuracy and relevance of recommendations. My main contribution to this project is conducting the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and developing the Content-Based Filtering (CBF) component within the final hybrid model.

Files in the Repository

## 1. EDA.ipynb
The EDA notebook includes data cleaning, visualization, and identifying key insights that guided the development of the recommendation system. The key highlights of this notebook are data preparation and cleaning, data visualisation and feature identification for recommendation model. 

## 2. CBF.ipynb
The CBF notebook consists of the implementation of the model, which I primarily worked on. The CBF model recommends books based on the similarity of their features to those of items the user has previously interacted with. The key highlights of this notebook include feature extraction and representation, similarity computation using methods like cosine similarity
and model evaluation and tuning.

## 3. Final Hybrid Recommender Model.ipynb
The final hybrid recommender model notebook showcases the combination of CF and CBF to form the final hybrid recommender. The hybrid approach aims to balance the strengths of individual models, CF and CBF. The key highlights of this notebook include the overview of the individual models (CBF, CF, etc.) and the performance evaluation of the hybrid model.
